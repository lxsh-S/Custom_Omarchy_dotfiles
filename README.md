## FILES

**I am currenty providing three files:**

- **.config(default omarchy)**

- **.config(user)**

- **waybar**


## LOCATION

- The .config(default omarchy) is located in the directory:- **~/.local/share/omarchy/default/hypr/**. 
    It's not expected to be changed as per the original omarchy documentation so take action accordingly.

- The other .config(user) is located in the directory:- ~/.config/hypr/.
